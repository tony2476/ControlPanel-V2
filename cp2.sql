Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States.

Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request.

This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.

We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group.

We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Your FundEX Advisor(s) may be registered through separate organizations for each purpose and as such, you may be dealing with more than one entity depending on the products purchased. Your FundEX Advisor(s) will provide the name of the entity being represented when insurance business is conducted. The sale of insurance products may not be the business of or under the supervision of FundEX Investments Inc. and FundEX may not be liable or responsible for such activities. Please refer to your FundEX statement for a listing of life insurance products which may be sold through FundEX Investments Inc. under its supervision.\n\nAll non-mutual fund related business conducted by Your FundEX Advisor(s) is not in the capacity of an employee or agent of FundEX Investments Inc. Accordingly, FundEX is not liable and/or responsible for any non-mutual fund related business conducted by Your FundEX Advisor(s). Such non-mutual fund related business is the responsibility of Your FundEX Advisor(s) alone.\n\nReferences in this Internet Website to third party goods or services should not be regarded as an endorsement of these goods or services.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information.

If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Your FundEX Advisor(s) may be registered through separate organizations for each purpose and as such, you may be dealing with more than one entity depending on the products purchased.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer.

Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.

Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us).

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Your FundEX Advisor(s) may be registered through separate organizations for each purpose and as such, you may be dealing with more than one entity depending on the products purchased.

Please refer to your FundEX statement for a listing of life insurance products which may be sold through FundEX Investments Inc. under its supervision.\n\nAll non-mutual fund related business conducted by Your FundEX Advisor(s) is not in the capacity of an employee or agent of FundEX Investments Inc.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer.

Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nONDAEDGE Financial Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Your FundEX Advisor(s) may be registered through separate organizations for each purpose and as such, you may be dealing with more than one entity depending on the products purchased.

The sale of insurance products may not be the business of or under the supervision of FundEX Investments Inc. and FundEX may not be liable or responsible for such activities. Please refer to your FundEX statement for a listing of life insurance products which may be sold through FundEX Investments Inc. under its supervision.\n\nAll non-mutual fund related business conducted by Your FundEX Advisor(s) is not in the capacity of an employee or agent of FundEX Investments Inc.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group.

Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you.

We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.

Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer.

Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information.

If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Disclaimer\n\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the simplified prospectus before investing. Mutual funds are not guaranteed and are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer. There can be no assurances that the fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per security at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment in the fund will be returned to you. Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Fund values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\n\nLabour Sponsored Investment Funds (\"LSIF\") have tax credits that are subject to certain conditions and are generally subject to recapture, if shares are redeemed within eight years. Please note that Mutual Fund Representatives in Alberta are not permitted to sell LSIF.\nAn investor proposing to borrow for the purchase of securities should be aware that a purchase with borrowed monies involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. The extent of that risk is a determination to be made by each purchaser and will vary depending on the circumstances of the purchaser and the securities purchased.\n\nDiscuss the risks associated with leveraged mutual fund purchases with an investment funds advisor before investing. Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.

Purchases are subject to suitability requirements. Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than a purchase using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same if the value of the securities purchased declines.\n\nInvestors should educate themselves regarding securities, taxation or exchange control legislation, which may affect them personally.

Our Privacy Policy also explains how we safeguard your personal information and your right to access that information.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nPersonal Information is any information about an individual that identifies him or her, such as financial, lifestyle or health information, but not their name, title or business address, telephone or email. \n\nPersonal information has to be protected regardless of its characteristics or its form, whether written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or any other form. \n\nPURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION\n\nCollecting information about you is necessary in order for us to provide you with high quality services. The nature and sensitivity of the information we collect about you varies according to the services we provide you and to legal requirements imposed on us (such as your social insurance number, where investment income is generated by a chosen product).\n\nThe purposes for which we collect personal information about you are identified at or before the time of collection. For example, information may be collected while submitting an application, opening an account, or submitting a claim. \n\nPurposes for collecting information generally include providing products or services requested, confirming your identity, protecting against fraud, or dealing with matters concerning the relationship between us.\n\nAny questions and concerns you may have regarding the purposes for collecting information may be directed to us at the address provided below.\n\nCONSENT\n\nWhen we collect personal information from you, we obtain your consent to use the information for the purposes collected.  We will obtain your consent for any additional use or collection, or if the purpose of using the information is changed.\n\nWe generally seek your express written consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information.  Where appropriate, for less sensitive information, we may accept your verbal consent. Occasionally, we may imply consent where we can infer consent from your action or inaction.\n\nConsent must be given by you or your authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions (for example, your right to withdraw consent is necessarily limited where we need information to extend a loan against the value of a policy issued by us). We will inform you of the consequences of such withdrawal, including the possibility that we may not be able to provide a product or process a request. If you choose not to consent, we will record the decision in our file.\n\nIn limited circumstances, we have the right (or obligation) to collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent. This occurs when legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the investigation of a potential breach of contract, the prevention or detection of fraud, or for law enforcement purposes, seeking consent might defeat the purpose of the information collection. Similarly, seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when you are a minor, seriously ill or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nLIMITS TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe limit the collection of your personal information to what we need in relation to the purposes identified to you.\n\nWe collect the information directly from you unless you allow us to collect information from a third party or in accordance with the law.\n\nWe limit the use of your personal information to the purposes we have identified to you. This means that we cannot use your personal information for other purposes without your consent, except as required by law.\n\nWe cannot disclose your personal information to anyone except with your consent or as required by law.\n\nYour personal information is only accessible to certain authorized persons, and only to the extent necessary to perform their duties.\n\nYou have the right to know, on request, to whom the information was disclosed.  Only in rare instances are we prevented by law from making such disclosure. We maintain accurate records, recording to whom we disclose personal information and in what circumstances it was disclosed.\n\nWe will occasionally share your personal information with service providers or agents to ensure the proper administration of products, or to provide you with the services you require.  These service providers or agents must agree to comply with privacy legislation before receiving any personal information.\n\nIn certain circumstances, we may use service providers outside Canada, including the United States. We are responsible for the service providers compliance with our Privacy Policy and will ensure that the level of protection of personal information is comparable to that provided by us. Any questions concerning the collection, transfer or use of personal information outside Canada can be forwarded to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below.\n\nRETENTION \n\nWe only retain your personal information for as long as needed for the purpose it was collected. We must destroy this information in accordance with the law and our file retention guidelines. When we destroy your personal information, we make sure that confidentiality is secured and that no unauthorized person can access the information during the destruction process. \n\nCLIENT LIST\n\nWe may establish a list of clients (names, addresses and telephone numbers) and share this list with other companies of the Industrial Alliance Group. The purpose of this list is to allow us to better serve you by offering relevant and available products and services. You may request that your name be removed from such a list by writing to the Privacy Officer at the address provided below. \n\nWe do not sell client lists to third parties.\n\nACCURACY\n\nWe make every possible effort to ensure that your personal information is as accurate and complete as necessary for the purposes it is collected, used, or disclosed.\n\nACCOUNTABILITY\n\nWe are responsible for your personal information in our possession or control, including information that may be transferred by us to third parties for processing.  We require such third parties to keep personal information under strict standards of privacy and protection.\nWe adhere to legislated and self-imposed rules, aimed to safeguard your privacy. The rules are established by this Privacy Policy, the Code of Business Conduct (applicable to directors, officers and employees), Market Conduct Standards (applicable to agents and brokers) as well as insurance industry guidelines and applicable law.\n\nOur staff is trained on these processes and procedures and is provided with information about privacy laws.\nSAFEGUARDS\n\nWe have implemented and continue to implement rigorous safeguards so that your personal information remains strictly confidential and is protected against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.\n\nProtection methods include organizational measures such as requiring security clearances and limiting access to a need-to-know\'\' basis, physical measures (e.g. building access cards for employees, visitor registration and identification cards, off-site backups and archiving), and technological measures such as the use of password and encryption (e.g. the use of routinely changing passwords, firewalls and segmented operator access).\n\nREQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AMENDMENTS\n\nYou have the right to be informed whether we hold personal information about you and to see that information. You also have the right to enquire as to how we collected your information, how we used it and to whom it may have been disclosed.\n\nThis information will be provided to you within a reasonable time from the date we receive your written request. We may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request. \n\nIn certain limited and specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide to you the requested information. Exceptions to your access right can include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, information that has been obtained in the course of an investigation of a potential breach of contract or fraud, and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n\nIn cases where we hold medical information about you, we may refuse to provide you with direct access to this information and may instead request that a health care professional be designated to provide the information to you.\n\nYou may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information. We will respond to an amendment request within a reasonable time.\n\nAny request for access to information or request for amendment must be sent to the following address:\n\nPrivacy Officer\nWealth Maximization Group\n400 Applewood Cres., 3rd Floor, Vaughan, ON   L4K 0C3\nToll free number: 1-800-324-6048\nEmail: AHrycko@fundex.com\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS\n\nOur employees and representatives are trained to respond to your questions or concerns about personal information.
